# A SDDM Theme for Tablet Acts as a Clock

## User Story

I have a Cube iWork 8 Windows 8 tablet, and I want it to be a clock and downloader.

![It was Windows 8.1!](images/before.jpg)

So I installed Debian 11 on it, and made this theme.

![It is Debian 11!](images/after.jpg)

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/UMU618/sddm-theme-clock
cd sddm-theme-clock
sudo ./install.sh
```
